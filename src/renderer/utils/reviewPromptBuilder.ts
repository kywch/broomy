- **Change Patterns**: Group related changes together. Don't just list every file - identify logical groups.
- **Potential Issues**: Only flag real concerns. Use severity levels:
  - \`info\`: Observations, suggestions, style preferences
  - \`warning\`: Potential bugs, edge cases, missing error handling
  - \`concern\`: Likely bugs, security issues, data loss risks
- **Design Decisions**: Note significant architectural choices, not trivial ones.
- **Requested Changes**: List specific changes you'd like to see addressed. Be concrete and actionable.
- Keep descriptions concise but informative.
- Use relative file paths from the repo root.
- Include specific line numbers where relevant.

## Output Format

Write your review to \`.broomy/review.md\` as a markdown document. Follow these rules:

- Use \`## Heading\` for each major section (the UI will auto-collapse these as collapsible sections)
- Use \`### Sub-heading\` for individual issues, findings, or change groups within a section
- Use \`- [ ] Check name\` for in-progress checks and \`- [x] Check name\` for completed checks (place these under the relevant \`###\` sub-heading)
- Sections with incomplete checkboxes (\`- [ ]\`) will stay expanded in the UI
- Include \`[View on GitHub](url)\` links for files/lines that link to the PR's GitHub page
- You can use \`<!-- include: .broomy/review-detail-name.md -->\` to break out sub-analyses into separate files — the UI will inline them when they exist
- Write the file incrementally — the UI polls and re-renders as you write
