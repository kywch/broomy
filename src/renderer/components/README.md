# Components

React UI components that make up Broomy's visual interface. Each component is a self-contained module handling its own local state, with shared state accessed via Zustand store hooks. Components communicate upward through callback props and downward through data props, following standard React patterns.

## How It Connects

`App.tsx` composes these components into a panels map that `Layout.tsx` renders into the resizable shell. Terminal components connect to backend PTY processes through `window.pty`. Explorer and FileViewer use `window.fs` and `window.git` for file system and git operations. NewSessionDialog and AgentSettings interact with the agent and repo stores for configuration. The `fileViewers/` subdirectory provides pluggable renderers that FileViewer delegates to.
