/**
 * Branch status computation from git state and persisted PR information.
 *
 * Implements a priority-based rule chain that maps a combination of local git
 * state (uncommitted files, ahead count, tracking branch, merge status) and
 * persisted PR state into one of six statuses: in-progress, pushed, empty, open,
 * merged, or closed. Persisted PR state is checked before the empty-branch
 * heuristic so that a known merged/closed/open PR is never misclassified when
 * the `hasHadCommits` sticky flag was missed (e.g. session was inactive during
 * the commit-and-merge cycle).
