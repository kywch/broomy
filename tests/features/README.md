# Feature Documentation Tests

Screenshot-driven E2E tests that exercise feature flows and generate visual HTML walkthroughs. Each subdirectory contains a Playwright spec that launches the app, steps through a feature, captures cropped screenshots at each stage, and produces an `index.html` report. The specs are committed; the generated screenshots and HTML are gitignored.

## How It Connects

Feature doc specs reuse the shared Electron fixture from `_shared/`, which launches a single Electron instance per worker with `E2E_TEST=true` and provides `resetApp()` for fast state resets. Screenshot helpers crop to relevant UI regions. The `generateFeaturePage()` and `generateIndex()` functions in `_shared/template.ts` produce the HTML output. These tests are run on demand with `pnpm test:feature-docs <slug>`, not as part of the regular `pnpm test:e2e` suite.
